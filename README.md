# pk-webs
A web interface for [pluralkit](https://pluralkit.me/).
Check it out at https://spectralitree.github.io/pk-webs/


### Please note:
This is a work in progress. The code is super messy, many features are not added yet, and I cannot guarantee that this is completely bugless. Feel free to open an issue if you notice anything amiss.

### Why does this exist?
You might be wondering this, considering https://pk.greysdawn.com/ already exists and functions just fine. My answer to that is: it didnt suit my exact needs. I also just wanted to see if I could write my own interface for pluralkit, since I'm new to programming and wanted to test my skills.

If you prefer greysdawn, that's perfectly fine! This is meant to be an alternative, not a competitor. If you miss any features from greysdawn, chances are they haven't been added yet, they are unable to be added, or I just haven't considered them! Again, feel free to open an issue.
